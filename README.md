- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, We are Ensmasteel! Ensmasteel is the robotic association of ISAE-ENSMA, a french engineering school ! 
- ðŸ‘€ We compete every year at the Franch robotic cup in order to demonstrate our work and competences !
- ðŸŒ± We mainly use C++ software in our bot, and we designe it on CATIA V5 to ensure perfect build and integration !

You may have already seen us on previous editions, and we hardly work every year to make our robot even better ! Have a look to our Robot repository to see what's new on our Robot, our technologies and global work ! 

- ðŸ“« If you want to send us a little mail, you can do it at ensmasteel.clubrobotique@gmail.com!

Don't forget to have a look at our site where you'll can find every documentation about the robot and the code !
