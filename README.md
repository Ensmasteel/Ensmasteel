### 👋 Hi, We Are Ensmasteel!  
We are the robotics association of **ISAE-ENSMA**, a prestigious French engineering school. Every year, we design, build, and program robots to compete in the **French Robotics Cup**, showcasing our technical skills and innovative spirit.

- **Design & Build**: Our robots are meticulously designed using **CATIA V5** to ensure precision and seamless integration.  
- **Code & Compete**: We primarily use **C++** to program our robots, enabling them to perform complex tasks during competitions.  
- **Innovate & Improve**: Each year, we push the boundaries of our robotics expertise to create even better, smarter, and more efficient robots.
